# Description
Do you enjoy challenges based in probabilities, you want to test yourself, or waste some time?
You just found a way to do so : Guess the number this program will choose. There are *4 levels*.
Each of them have *increasing difficulty* and different number of tries available.

# Usage
There are no specifics other than knowing how to run a script from a terminal or command prompt
If you don't here is how :
1. Open a Terminal / CMD (UNIX/WINDOWS)
2. Type 'ruby guessNum.rb' without the quotes
3. Play

# Requirements
You need to install Ruby unless we release executable packages for all operating systems in the future (far distant future).
You can get Ruby at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/


# Contributors
Please, if anyone wants to, modify/add new levels. Contact me through GitHub or other ways I have mentioned in my Bio and I will add you as a contributor.


Other tasks that would apply for contributors would be :

1. Porting the script to .exe, and other executable and easy ways Linux and Apple users would be able to run this as an application.
2. Fixing bugs wherever they appear.
3. More tasks that will pop-up later.


No matter your reason, send me a message stating the reason you would like to contribute and I will add you or keep you in mind for the future.
